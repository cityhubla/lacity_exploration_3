##This is an exploration identifying
* Properties identified as Single Family Residences (SFR) in the City of Los Angeles.
* A chart was created showing how many properties are based on the assessed land base year and a comparision of those properties with those rolled back by Proposition 13 (A California Voter's Initiative passed in 1978 reducing property tax rates on homes, businesses and farms).
* Data was filtered by 
 * TaxRateArea_CITY = LOS ANGELES
 * PropertyType = SFR
* Data for chart made using pivot tables in Excel (data can be downloaded on this repo)
